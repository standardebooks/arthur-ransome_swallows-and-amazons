				<img alt="A map of the region where the Swallows and Amazons spend their summer, after the style of John’s chart. A long, narrow lake is depicted, with north pointing to the left. In the middle of the upper (east) shore is Rio, with Holly Howe, Dixon’s Farm, and the “Savages” (charoal-burners) spaced out to the right (south). Houseboat Bay and Darien are near Holly Howe. Wild Cat Island is opposite Dixon’s Farm, with Cormorant Island just off the opposite (west) shore. A number of islands lie opposite Rio’s bay. Towards the north end of the lake (left) and on its west short (lower) is the inlet where the Amazons live, with Octopus Lagoon well beyond their boathouse." src="../images/illustration-1.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent"/>
